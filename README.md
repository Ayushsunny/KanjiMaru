# KanjiMaru

Flashcard and Kanji writing mobile app made in Flutter. After a somewhat long hiatus, I have decided to resume this Hobby Project of mine. 

As I have been frustrated by the fact that apps on the market do not provide a 'good' way to learn to write Japanese Characters, I have decided to create my own app.  

Inspired by both Anki and WaniKani, tools which I still use at the moment on my Japanese learning journey. While they are great tools, I have been wanting to create something of my own for a while.

Although the idea is to have this app be open source, if I ever decide to publish it, I might make this repo private, as I am not sure on the licensing.

## UI
`Current Mock 'Overview Screen.`

It comes from an adorable fluff ball named Maru. The reason I remember the Kanji 'ä¸¸'.
